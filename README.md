# Hangfire 🔥

A wishlist app meets personal finance tool that helps you combat impulse purchases by making you think twice about what you really want.

## 📖 Overview

Hangfire is a React Native mobile app built with Expo that gamifies the process of managing a wishlist. Instead of buying things impulsively, you add them to your Hangfire list. Each day you get 15 points to allocate to items you want most. Over time, you'll see which items you consistently prioritize and which were just fleeting desires.

**Core Philosophy**: "Hold on... Hang fire... before you buy."

## ✨ Features

### Daily Points System
- Get **15 points per day** to allocate to your wishlist items
- Points reset daily automatically
- Upvote (↑) items you want most today
- Downvote (↓) to undo recent votes and redistribute points
- Visual feedback when you run out of points

### Reddit-Style Voting
- Upvote/downvote arrows (↑/↓) instead of traditional plus/minus
- Smooth animations when voting
- Disabled state indicators (grey when unavailable, green when active)
- Haptic feedback on interactions

### Smart Item Management
- **Product URL scraping**: Paste a product link and auto-extract name, price, and image
- **Multiple options**: Add variants/alternatives for each item (e.g., different bike models)
- **Purchase tracking**: Mark items as purchased with dates
- **Flexible sorting**: Sort by points, date added, or price
- **Image support**: Upload photos or scrape from URLs

### Data Persistence
- All data stored locally with AsyncStorage
- Survives app restarts
- Daily points automatically reset based on date

### Share Extension Support
- Share product URLs directly to Hangfire from Safari or any iOS app that exposes the native share sheet
- Auto-opens the add item modal with the shared link pre-filled
- Automatic product data scraping kicks off as soon as the modal appears

## 🏗 Architecture

### Main Component: `MainApp`

The entire app is currently contained in a single `App.tsx` file with the following structure:

#### State Management
- `items`: Array of wishlist items
- `remainingPoints`: Daily points remaining (0-15)
- `lastResetDate`: Tracks when points were last reset
- `selectedItem`: Currently viewed item in detail modal
- Various UI state (modals, forms, sorting, etc.)

#### Key Data Types

```typescript
type WishlistItem = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  link?: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  points: number;
  dateAdded: string;
  isPurchased: boolean;
  datePurchased?: string;
  options?: ItemOption[];
  selectedOptionId?: string;
}

type ItemOption = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  link?: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
}
```

#### Core Functions

**Voting System**
- `addPoint(id)`: Adds a point to an item (upvote)
- `removePoint(id)`: Removes a point from an item (downvote)
- `animateUpvote(id)`: Triggers bounce animation on upvote arrow
- `animatePtsLeftEmpty()`: Animates the "pts left" badge when reaching 0

**Item Management**
- `saveNewItem()`: Creates a new wishlist item
- `confirmDelete(id)`: Deletes an item with confirmation
- `togglePurchased(id)`: Marks/unmarks item as purchased
- `updateItemImage(id)`: Changes item photo

**Options/Variants**
- `addOptionToItem()`: Adds a variant to an item
- `selectOptionAsMain()`: Sets the active variant
- `deleteOption()`: Removes a variant

**Product Scraping**
- `scrapeProductData(url)`: Extracts name, price, and image from URL
- `scrapeImageFromUrl(url)`: Finds best product image from HTML

**Sorting & Filtering**
- Supports sorting by: points (default), date added, price
- Can hide/show purchased items
- Temporarily freezes sorting during point changes for smooth UX

### Animations

The app uses React Native's `Animated` API for smooth interactions:

- **Point counter**: Scales up when voting
- **Upvote arrow**: Individual bounce animation per item
- **Pts left badge**: Double-bounce when hitting 0 points
- **Pressable feedback**: Scale transforms on button presses

### Theming

Automatic dark/light mode support based on device settings:
- Colors defined in `theme` object
- Adjusts text, backgrounds, borders dynamically
- Green accent color (`#4A7C59`) for branding

## 🎨 UI Components

### Homepage
- Header with points counter and add button
- FlatList of wishlist cards
- Each card shows: image, name, price, points, voting arrows
- Footer with sort toggle and filter switch

### Item Details Modal
- Large product image with edit button
- Name and price (editable)
- Voting arrows with point counter
- Purchase link button
- Options/variants list
- Action buttons (mark purchased, delete)

### Add Item Modal
- URL input with auto-scraping
- Manual fields: name, price, image URL
- Photo picker integration
- Scraped data preview

## 🔄 Daily Reset Logic

```typescript
function getTodayKey(): string {
  return new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10); // yyyy-mm-dd
}
```

On app load, compares `lastResetDate` with today's date. If different, resets `remainingPoints` to 15.

## 💾 Data Persistence

All state is persisted to AsyncStorage under key `wishlist_app_state_v2`:

```typescript
type PersistedState = {
  items: WishlistItem[];
  remainingPoints: number;
  lastResetDate: string;
}
```

Auto-saves on every state change via `useEffect`.

## 🔗 Deep Linking & Share Extension

Hangfire registers the custom URL scheme `hangfire://` and understands both of the following formats:

- `hangfire://share?url=<encodedProductUrl>` (preferred)
- `hangfire://share/<encodedProductUrl>` (legacy fallback)

When a supported link is received, the app automatically opens the add item modal, pre-fills the product link, and starts scraping product data.

### Testing the iOS Share Extension

1. Build & install the app on a device or simulator (`npx expo run:ios` or via Xcode).
2. Open any URL in Safari (e.g. a Nike product page) and tap the share icon.
3. Tap `More` → enable **Hangfire Share** if it is not already visible, then add it to your favorites for quick access.
4. Select **Hangfire Share**. The extension briefly shows a loading view, triggers the deep link, and dismisses.
5. Hangfire opens (or comes to the foreground) with the current URL already pasted into the add item view.
